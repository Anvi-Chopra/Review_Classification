# Movie_Review_Classification
## Description
* The goal of this project is to design a software for Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews. 
* There can be two categories of users- **movie critics and movie watchers** for this website. 
* Critics can visit the website to enter a review for a particular movie. The review that 
is given will then be analysed and will be categorized according to the sentiment it displays. 
* The review for the movie is calculated on the basis of this sentiment.
* This data will be stored in a database server. 
* Movie watchers
can access the website to search for and read reviews about particular movies according to their interests, and will also be able 
to view the rating that has been given for that particular movie according to the reviews and the sentiments that have been analysed 
from them.
